        There is a nice saying by a great man that \"A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing left to take away\". Indeed, a designer is a creator, creator of every single thing which we witness today. Starting from a needle to a spaceship, everywhere designers are required. And they need to be perfect and flawless. If you also think that you are with the calibre, then show that using coding as your sword and achieving victory.

        It's not a Bug, it's a feature!\"It is always the teeny tiny shingles that end up causing glitches. Experience the thrill of spotting that anomaly which could bring you the ultimate glory. Get your magnifying glasses ready and your Sherlock hats on. It is time to test your capabilities, when one small ';' could make or mar your code. So gear up to test your coding skills.

        221B, Baker Street. He\u2019s back. And he was looking for this very opportunity to announce his presence. Every fairy tale needs a good old fashioned villain. But with Sherlock not in town, it\u2019s no more a fairy tale. Can you match his intellect and keep the game in balance? Do you have it in you to confront Moriarty? Solve clues, think outside the box and prove yourselves in this game of alertness and concentration.

        In an age where entrepreneurship and freelancing rule supreme, it is often not enough to know how to code well but to know how to get others to code for you. CodeMart is a coding event with a twist - the objective is not to solve your own programs but to maximize your objective function. This is a team event, with teams consisting of up to two members. You are welcome to take part by yourself if you so wish. There will only be one, albeit longer than usual, round.
